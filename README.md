# IgnaBot

My first project and Discord bot ever made, I originally made this as a fun way to practise progamming(and getting that sweet Active Developer Badge).
The code probably wonÂ´t be as easy to read by something that I have already mentioned, once i finish all the features i will rewrite the code though.

IgnaBot is a Discord bot which does a little of everything, such as but not limited to: audio streaming, moderation, jokes, etc.
